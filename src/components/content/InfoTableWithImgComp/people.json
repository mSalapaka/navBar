			"shortBiography": "His research spans several areas where he has worked extensively on, consensus and communication networks, and applications in nanotechnology. His work bridges systems area with many domain areas. His work gets regularly cited in leading publications such as science and nature. In his research, he has led substantial projects where he has ably coordinated multiple parts of the projects and directed personnel and experts from different areas to successful completion of projects; one such relevant lead effort was coordination and execution of control framework for a residential solutions for managing renewable energy sources and loads in 2013. He coordinated and guided a team comprised of Blake Lundstrom, Brian Benjamin Johnson, and Srinivasa Salapaka toward a successful completion of the project. He has written over 100 peer reviewed articles 4 book chapters and a book on multi-objective control synthesis. He together with his collaborators has also developed a matlab based software for synthesizing controllers with multi-objective criteria and structural constraints.",
