            "descr": "Abstract: Determining interrelatedness structure of various entities from multiple time series data is of significant interest to many areas. Knowledge of such a structure can aid in identifying cause and effect relationships, clustering of similar entities, identification of representative elements and model reduction. In this talk, a methodology for identifying the interrelatedness structure of dynamically related time series data based on passive observations will be presented. The framework will allow for the presence of loops in the connectivity structure of the network. The quality of the reconstruction will be quantified. Results on the how the sparsity of multivariate Wiener filter, the Granger filter and the causal Wiener filter depend on the network structure will be presented. Connections to graphical models with notions of independence posed by d-separation will be highlighted. ",

            "descr": "The University of Minnesota will develop a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges to system reliability and power quality presented by widespread stochastic renewable power generation. By developing techniques for both centralized cloud-based and distributed peer-to-peer networks, the proposed system will enable coordinated response of many local units to adjust consumption and generation of energy, satisfy physical constraints, and provide ancillary services requested by a grid operator. The project will apply concepts from nonlinear and robust control theory to design self-organizing power systems that effectively respond to the grid events and variability. A key feature enabled by the proposed methodology is a flexible plug and play architecture wherein devices and small power networks can easily engage or disengage from other power networks or the grid.",

            "descr": "Cells, to carry out many important functions, employ an elaborate transport network with bio-molecular components forming roadways as well as vehicles. The transport is achieved with remarkable robustness under a very uncertain environment. The main goal of this proposal is to understand how biology achieves such functionality and leveraging the knowledge toward realizing effective engineered transport mechanisms for micron sized cargo. The realization of a robust infrastructure that enables simultaneous transport of many micron and smaller sized particles will have a transformative impact on a vast range of areas such as medicine, drug development, electronics, and bio-materials. A key challenge here is to probe the mechanisms often at the nanometer scale as the bio-molecular components are at tens of nanometer scale. The main tools for addressing these challenges come from an engineering perspective that is guided by existing insights from biology.  The proposal will bring together researchers from engineering and biology and it provides an integrated environment for students. Moreover, it is known that an impaired transport mechanism can underlie many neurodegenerative maladies, and as the research here pertains to studying intracellular transport, discoveries hold the potential for shedding light on what causes the impaired transport.

This paradigm makes it possible to probe motor proteins at higher speeds and also allows for real-time step estimation for step sizes as small as 8 nm with dwell time of 5 ms or higher without sacrificing force regulation.

Furthermore, we have developed a method where the higher mode participation is reconstructed with high fidelity, and presented a scheme for high bandwidth detection of higher modes when their participation becomes significant. These methods are shown to outperform the traditional amplitude-phase demodulation schemes in terms of speed, resolution, and fidelity. The framework developed is tested on simulations and the method's utility for first two modes is demonstrated experimentally. The results have appeared in Applied Physics Letters. ",
