For capacity minimization, we formulate three operational phases in survivable WDM network operation viz., initial call set up, short/medium-term reconfiguration, and long-term reconfiguration. All three phases are derived from a single integer linear programming (ILP) formulation. This common framework incorporates service disruption. We modify the framework for revenue maximization that includes a service differentiation model based on lightpath protection. We propose a multistage solution methodology to solve individual service classes sequentially and combine them to obtain a feasible solution. We provide cost comparisons in terms of increase in revenue obtained by various service classes with the base case of accepting demands without any protection.

  abstract={Several methods have been developed for joint working and spare capacity planning in survivable wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) networks. These methods have considered a static traffic demand and optimized the network cost assuming various cost models and survivability paradigms. Our interest primarily lies in network operation under dynamic traffic. We formulate various operational phases in survivable WDM networks as a single integer linear programming (ILP) optimization problem. This common framework avoids service disruption to the existing connections. However, the complexity of the optimization problem makes the formulation applicable only for network provisioning and offline reconfiguration. The direct use of this method for online reconfiguration remains limited to small networks with few tens of wavelengths. Our goal in this paper is to develop an algorithm for fast online reconfiguration. We propose a heuristic algorithm based on LP relaxation technique to solve this problem. Since the ILP variables are relaxed, we provide a way to derive a feasible solution from the relaxed problem. The algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, the network topology is processed based on the demand set to be provisioned. This preprocessing step is done to ensure that the LP yields a feasible solution. The preprocessing step in our algorithm is based on: (a) the assumption that in a network, two routes between any given node pair are sufficient to provide effective fault tolerance and (b) an observation on the working of the ILP for such networks. In the second step, using the processed topology as input, we formulate and solve the LP problem. Interestingly, the LP relaxation heuristic yielded a feasible solution to the ILP in all our experiments. We provide insights into why the LP formulation yields a feasible solution to the ILP We demonstrate the use of our algorithm on practical size backbone networks with hundreds of wavelengths per link. The results indicate that the run time of our heuristic algorithm is fast enough (in order of seconds) to be used for online reconfiguration

Related experiments that establish the feasibility of thermally driven FM-AFM in ambient room conditions have achieved tip-sample separations less than 2 nm with long term separation stability (greater than 30 min). Employing this method a narrowband 250 Hz modulation of the tip-sample separation was detected with a vertical resolution of 0.25 � in a 0.4 Hz bandwidth. The corresponding estimated force sensitivity is 7 fN. In all experiments the cantilever tip was maintained in the attractive regime of the tip-sample interactions. This demonstrates a thermally driven non-contact mode operation of AFM. It also provides a limits of performance study of small amplitude FM-AFM methods.}

The dominant first harmonic is analyzed using multivalued frequency responses and the corresponding stability conditions. The ability of the simple tip-sample interaction model to capture the intricate nonlinear behavior of the first harmonic is demonstrated.

  abstract={This article describes new perspectives on SPM-related science and technology, based on systems and control theory. These perspectives have led to a better understanding of SPM technology, overcome hurdles that limited the efficacy of SPM, and resulted in new modes of SPM-based interrogation. ThNcAFM, based on systems principles, has made it possible to image with resolution as high as 0.25 Aring in ambient conditions. The orders-of-magnitude improvements achieved in areas such as precision positioning, sample imaging, and sample detection rates emphasize the potential of systems tools in nanotechnology. The concept of using models in online operation has significant potential for SPM. For instance, TF-AFM, which uses models for online operation, resolves competing objectives of high resolution and detection rate by using a design from a systems perspective that makes detection bandwidth independent of the quality factor of the probe and, therefore, independent of resolution. The systems perspective also facilitates the interpretation of data since it provides a precise means for delineating the effects of the inherent dynamics of the interrogation system from the properties of the sample being probed. Devices such as SPMs are sensitive to operating conditions, ambient conditions, and modeling inaccuracies. Modern control theory provides a framework where such challenges can be effectively addressed. This aspect translates to reliable experiments in terms of repeatability, which is crucial in many nanoscience studies.

In this work, we consider a data storage system that operates by encoding information as topographic profiles on a polymer medium. A cantilever probe with a sharp tip (few nm radius) is used to create and sense the presence of topographic profiles, resulting in a density of few Tb per inch square. The prevalent mode of using the cantilever probe is the static mode that is harsh on the probe and the media. In this article, the high quality factor dynamic mode operation, that is less harsh on the media and the probe, is analyzed. The read operation is modeled as a communication channel which incorporates system memory due to inter-symbol interference and the cantilever state. We demonstrate an appropriate level of abstraction of this complex nanoscale system that obviates the need for an involved physical model. Next, a solution to the maximum likelihood sequence detection problem based on the Viterbi algorithm is devised. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the performance of this detector is several orders of magnitude better than the performance of other existing schemes.},

There are relatively fewer reports on the AFM imaging of yeast cells [1] (Kasas and Ikai, 1995), [2] (Gad and Ikai, 1995). Yeasts have thick and mechanically strong cell walls and are therefore difficult to attach to a solid substrate. In this report, a new immobilization technique for the height mode imaging of living yeast cells in solid media using AFM is presented. The proposed technique allows the cell surface to be almost completely exposed to the environment and studied using AFM. Apart from the new immobilization protocol, for the first time, height mode imaging of live yeast cell surface in intermittent contact mode is presented in this report. Stable and reproducible imaging over a 10-h time span is observed. A significant improvement in operational stability will facilitate the investigation of growth patterns and surface patterns of yeast cells.

There is a nonlinear relationship between photodiode outputs and bead position but for small displacements linear approximation holds well. Traditionally, the nonlinearity is compensated by normalizing the photodiode's position signal with the intensity signal and then using a polynomial fit in the range where voltage to position mapping is one to one. In this article, this range is extended by using the intensity signal as an independent input along with the two position signals. A map from the input signals to the actual position values is obtained. This mapping is one-to-one for a larger range that results in an increased detection range. An artificial neural network that facilitates implementation is employed for this purpose. This scheme is implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array based data acquisition and control hardware with closed loop bandwidth of 50 kHz. Detection of the order of 350 nm from the center of detection laser is demonstrated for a 500 nm diameter bead compared to 180 nm achieved by a polynomial fit.

   abstract={Over the past few decades, single molecule investigations employing optical tweezers, AFM and TIRF microscopy have revealed that molecular behaviors are typically characterized by discrete steps or events that follow changes in protein conformation. These events, that manifest as steps or jumps, are short-lived transitions between otherwise more stable molecular states. A major limiting factor in determining the size and timing of the steps is the noise introduced by the measurement system. To address this impediment to the analysis of single molecule behaviors, step detection algorithms incorporate large records of data and provide objective analysis. However, existing algorithms are mostly based on heuristics that are not reliable and lack objectivity. Most of these step detection methods require the user to supply parameters that inform the search for steps. They work well, only when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is high and stepping speed is low. In this report, we have developed a novel step detection method that performs an objective analysis on the data without input parameters, and based only on the noise statistics. The noise levels and characteristics can be estimated from the data providing reliable results for much smaller SNR and higher stepping speeds. An iterative learning process drives the optimization of step-size distributions for data that has unimodal step-size distribution, and produces extremely low false positive outcomes and high accuracy in finding true steps. Our novel methodology, also uniquely incorporates compensation for the smoothing affects of probe dynamics. A mechanical measurement probe typically takes a finite time to respond to step changes, and when steps occur faster than the probe response time, the sharp step transitions are smoothed out and can obscure the step events. To address probe dynamics we accept a model for the dynamic behavior of the probe and invert it to reveal the steps. No other existing method addresses the impact of probe dynamics on step detection. Importantly, we have also developed a comprehensive set of tools to evaluate various existing step detection techniques. We quantify the performance and limitations of various step detection methods using novel evaluation scales. We show that under these scales, our method provides much better overall performance. The method is validated on different simulated test cases, as well as experimental data.}

  	abstract={Determining interrelatedness structure of various entities from multiple time series data is of significant interest to many areas. Knowledge of such a structure can aid in identifying cause and effect relationships, clustering of similar entities, identification of representative elements and model reduction. The majority of existing results are based on correlation based indices which effectively assume a static relationship between the time series data and are not suitable for detecting interrelatedness when the time series are dynamically related or when the time series involve loops. In this paper, a methodology for identifying the interrelatedness structure of dynamically related time series data is presented that also allows for the presence of loops in the connectivity structure. A linear dynamic graph model is presented where it is assumed that each time series data is the sum of an independent stochastic noise source and a dynamically weighted sum of other time series data. A link is assumed to be present between two time series if the weight of a time series, which is a linear time-invariant filter, is nonzero in the formation of the other. Reconstruction of the link connectivity structure under various scenarios is considered. It is shown that when the linear dynamic graph is allowed to admit non-causal weights, then the links structure can be recovered with the possibility of identifying spurious connections. However, it is shown that the spurious links remain local, where, a spurious link is restricted to be within one hop of a true link. Furthermore, strategies for exact reconstruction of the link structure when the weights are restricted to be causal are developed. The main tools for determining the network topology are based on variations of Wiener filtering. A significant insight provided by the article is that, in the class of network models considered in the paper, the Wiener filter estimating a stochastic process based on other processes remain- local in the sense that the Wiener filter utilizes only measurements local to the node being estimated.}

In this paper, we report a method for simultaneously determining the topography, stiffness and dissipative properties of materials at the nanoscale in a probe based dynamic mode operation. The method is particularly suited for investigating soft-matter such as polymers and bio-matter. We use perturbation analysis tools for mapping dissipative and stiffness properties of material into parameters of an equivalent linear time-invariant model. Parameters of the equivalent model are adaptively estimated, where, for robust estimation, a multi-frequency excitation of the probe is introduced. We demonstrate that the reported method of simultaneously determining multiple material properties can be implemented in real-time on existing probe based instruments. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by investigating properties of a polymer blend in real-time.}

In this article a systematic methodology for designing open-loop Brownian ratchet mechanisms that optimize velocity and efficiency is developed. In the case where the particle position is available as a measured variable, closed loop methodologies are studied.

abstract={Detection of a model from a set of models that best describes the behavior of a system is of
primary importance in many applications. In this article two discriminating signals are derived from
measurements for a plant that switches between two model behaviors, where the transfer functions
from inputs to the two signals are identical when one model is effective while they are negative of
each other when the other model is effective. The developed detection algorithm called the innovation
squared mismatch is utilized for the read operation of probe based data storage. The innovations squared
mismatch method offers better detection performance with significantly less computational complexity
compared to prevalently used maximum a posteriori probability based methods in current data storage
systems. The article further proposes employing maximum likelihood sequence detection based methods
where the plant behavior can switch from one model to another at high rates and the transients from a
previous behavior affect the current behavior causing inter-symbol interference. Exhaustive simulation
and experimental results corroborate the efficiency of the proposed methods..}
