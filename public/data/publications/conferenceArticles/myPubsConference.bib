The cantilever is vibrated by a sinusoidal input, and its deflection is detected optically. We analyze the forced dynamics using the Melnikov method, which reveals the region in the space of physical parameters where chaotic motion is possible. In addition, using a proportional and derivative controller we compute the Melnikov function in terms of the parameters of the controller. Using this relation it is possible to design controllers that will remove the possibility of chaos},

In existing dynamic mode AFM methods steady-state response of microcantilever is monitored for imaging tip-surface interaction forces at the nano-scale. In these methods microcantilevers with high quality factor are employed for high force sensitivity but at the cost of speed due to dependence on steady-state signals. In this paper, a novel methodology for fast interrogation of material that exploits the transient part of the cantilever response is presented. This method effectively addresses the perceived fundamental limitation on bandwidth due to high quality factors. Analysis and experiments show that the method results in significant increase in bandwidth and resolution as compared to the steady-state-based methods. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of a systems perspective to the field of imaging at the nano-scale and for the first time reports real-time imaging at the nanoscale using the transient method with scan speed 40 times faster than conventional methods.},

This is often done by calculating the power spectrum of the fluctuations of the trapped bead observed on a photodetector. The detection process entails observing the deflection of either the same trapping beam or a different laser beam of very low power. We present a new approach where a laser beam from a source is split into s- and p-polarizations where s-polarization is used for trapping and p-polarization for detection. We also analyze and experimentally verify the effect of the detection beam on the trap dynamics. We further explain how to incorporate the effect of a strong detection beam, capable of trapping beads, in the photodetector calibration in a dual beam trap scenario. The novel detection method and the associated modelling sets the stage for the application of modern control approach.},

A communication system model which incorporates modeling of the cantilever interaction with media is proposed for the system. We demonstrate that by using a controllable canonical state space representation, the entire system can be visualized as a channel with a single input which is the tip-media interaction force. A hypothesis testing formulation for bit-by-bit detection is developed. We present three different classes of detectors for this hypothesis test. In particular, we consider two different cases where statistics on the tip-medium interaction are available and not available. Simulation results are presented for all these detectors and their relative merits are explored.},

abstract={This article tackles the problem of estimating the domain of attraction of a Lur'e system, that is the feedback interconnection of a linear time-invariant system with a memoryless static operator. When the dimension of the system is large, numerical approaches based on simulations become prohibitive from a computational point of view. On the other hand, classical analytical techniques based on Lyapunov functions provide conservative estimates because they usually consider quadratic Lyapunov functions. Another limit is given by the fact that they deal with contractively invariant sets, which are sets where the derivative of the Lyapunov function along the trajectories is negative. Methods to reduce their conservativeness are still a challenging subject of research and desirable for many practical applications. In this paper, we try to combine the information given by more Lyapunov functions together in order to enlarge the estimate of the domain of attraction. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that the sets we are considering are invariant but not necessarily contractively invariant. We assume that an estimate of the attraction domain is already known. In order to show that a set is part of the attraction domain, it is sufficient to prove that all the trajectories starting from it reach the current estimate in a finite time. This concept provides a method to iteratively improve the attraction domain estimate using different Lyapunov functions without limiting the analysis to contractively invariant sets. After developing a general theory, we only resort to the use of quadratic Lyapunov functions because of the computational appeal given by LMI solvers.},

abstract={Lur'e systems, that are described by the feedback interconnection of a linear time invariant system and a nonlinear system, form an important class of nonlinear systems arising in many modern applications. A number of absolute stability criteria are available where the stability is guaranteed with the nonlinearity restricted to a pre-specified set. Most of these criteria provide sufficient conditions for absolute stability, thus lessening the conservativeness remains a challenge. A method of reducing conservativeness is to first estimate the part of the nonlinearity that is appropriate from an asymptotic sense followed by the application of a preferred absolute stability criteria to the more restricted nonlinearity. A comprehensive framework that incorporates the above approach is developed in this paper that employs a methodology based on integral quadratic constraints as a means of describing the nonlinearity. It is shown that the developed framework can be used to conclude absolute stability of Lur'e interconnections where all of the existing criteria fail to be satisfied. Indeed, examples are provided where the nonlinearity does not fall into the classes assumed by existing absolute criteria. Another contribution of the article is the extension of IQC theory.},

In this work, we consider a data storage system that operates by encoding information as topographic profiles on a polymer medium. A cantilever probe with a sharp tip (few nm radius) is used to create and sense the presence of topographic profiles, resulting in a density of few Tb per in.2. The prevalent mode of using the cantilever probe is the static mode that is harsh on the probe and the media. In this article, the high quality factor dynamic mode operation, that is less harsh on the media and the probe, is analyzed. The read operation is modeled as a communication channel which incorporates system memory due to inter-symbol interference and the cantilever state. We demonstrate an appropriate level of abstraction of this complex nanoscale system that obviates the need for an involved physical model. Next, a solution to the maximum likelihood sequence detection problem based on the Viterbi algorithm is devised. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the performance of this detector is several orders of magnitude better than the performance of other existing schemes.},

abstract={Nano-imaging has played a vital role in biology, chemistry and physics as it enables interrogation of material with sub-nanometer resolution. Primary means of achieving such atomic scale interrogation of matter are based on the principles of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). However, current nano-imaging techniques are too slow to be useful in the high speed applications of interest such as studying the evolution of certain biological processes over time that involve very small time scales. In this work, we present a high speed one-bit imaging technique using dynamic mode AFM with a high quality factor cantilever. We model the high quality factor cantilever system using a Markovian model which incorporates the inherent system memory due to the inter-symbol interference and the cantilever state. Next, we pose the imaging problem as one of finding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) symbol detector for this model. This is solved by adapting the BCJR algorithm for our channel model. Furthermore, we propose an improved MAP symbol detector that incorporates a learned prior from the previous scan line while detecting the features on the current scan line. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm provides significantly better image resolution compared to current nano-imaging techniques at high scanning speed.},

The Viterbi algorithm can be adapted for performing maximum likelihood sequence detection in such channels. However, the problem of finding an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate of the Viterbi detector in this case has not been fully investigated. Current techniques rely on an exhaustive enumeration of short error events and determine the BER using a union bound. In this work, we consider a subset of the class of ISI channels with data dependent Gauss-Markov noise. We derive an upper bound on the pairwise error probability (PEP) between the transmitted bit sequence and the decoded bit sequence that can be expressed as a product of functions depending on current and previous states in the (incorrect) decoded sequence and the (correct) transmitted sequence. In general, the PEP is asymmetric. The average BER over all possible bit sequences is then determined using a pairwise state diagram. Simulations results which corroborate the analysis of upper bound, demonstrate that analytic bound on BER is tight in high SNR regime. In the high SNR regime, our proposed upper bound obviates the need for computationally expensive simulation.},

All current AFM employ either stacked or cylindrical piezoceramic actuators for both longitudinal and transverse positioning of the sample. An inherent property of these materials is the presence of hysteresis and constitutive nonlinearities, even at the low drive levels employed for angstrom-level resolution. At low frequencies, standard feedback mechanisms effectively attenuate the hysteresis, whereas noise at high frequencies diminishes the efficacy of feedback and leads to unacceptable accuracy. In this paper, we discuss modeling techniques which provide a first step toward high speed nanopositioning for applications ranging from macroscopic product evaluation to real-time imaging of biological processes.},

It is shown that the system classes presented have the common feature that all stabilizing controllers can be characterized by convex constraints on the Youla-Kucera parameter. Using this feature, a solution to a general optimal performance problem that incorporates time domain and frequency domain constraints is obtained. A synthesis procedure is provided which, at every step, yields a feasible controller together with a measure of its performance with respect to the optimal performance. Convergence to the optimal performance is established. An example of a multi-node network congestion control problem is provided that illustrates the effectiveness of the developed methodology..},

abstract={In atomic force microscopy, bandwidth or resolution can be affected by active quality factor (Q) control. However, in existing methods the trade off between resolution and bandwidth remains inherent. Observer based Q control method provides greater flexibility in managing the tradeoff between resolution and bandwidth during imaging. It also facilitates theoretical analysis lacking in existing methods. Steady state signals like amplitude and phase are slowly varying variables that are suited to image low bandwidth content of the actual sample profile. Observer based transient imaging scheme with Q control has the promise of detecting high bandwidth content of the sample features during scanning. Transient detection also has the advantage of high sensitivity to small features},

The effect of sub-controller to sub-controller communication noise on the performance is considered along with the constraint on strength of sub-controller to sub-controller communication signal. We take an input-output approach. In a 2-nest case, we obtain a sufficient condition for splitting the stabilizing controller such that the overall performance optimization can be cast as a convex problem in the Youla-Kucera parameter Q.

A BSA protein coated polystyrene bead, held stationary in an optical trap, is chemically grafted to AFM cantliever tip functionalized by the complementary protein- anti BSA. This arrangement also provides a flexible means of reversibly and irreversibly fusing polystyrene beads thermally at desired specified locations on the micro-cantilever, by heating the silicon tip with the focused laser beam of the optical tweezers. We use optical tweezers as a micro-manipulation tool for grafting pre-specified number of beads to cantilever in a controlled fashion as against the other widely used methods where an aggregate of molecules are chemically attached. Further, we study the changes in cantilever's resonant frequency and find it in good agreement with the expected change due to the additional bead mass. This study opens up opportunities in the area of biosensors by providing a method to standardize the calibration of chemically modified cantilevers},

The model comprises of a stochastic system where the system switches between two stochastic differential systems, where the switching criteria is a state-dependent stochastic variable. Simulations demonstrate that the feedback mechanism helps achieve an increased average velocity of transport and corroborates the hypothesis that a motor protein can achieve higher speeds of transport by restricting or enabling attachment/detachment of ATP/ADP like molecules depending on conformational changes in the motor-protein.}

Flashing ratchets are used to model certain transport mechanisms of molecular motors and are of special interest to biologists and biophysicists. Mathematically they are are modeled by stochastic hybrid systems. For an open-loop design of on-times and off-times, we derive, under certain practical assumptions, an exact probability density function that reflects the spatial distribution of particles in space after the ratchet has flashed a given number of times, and find an optimal off-time that maximizes the transport velocity for a specific ratchet potential. Validation of the underlying assumptions is also presented. Simulation results show that these open-loop designs achieve as good or better average velocities for particles over certain well known existing feedback strategies in literature.}

Both the cases of non-causal and causal links are considered. By using only the measurements of the node outputs and without assuming any prior knowledge of the network topology, a method is provided to estimate the graph connectivity. In particular, it is proven that the method determines links to be present only between a node and its “kins”, where kins of a node consist of parents, children and co-parents (other parents of all of its children) in the graph. With the additional hypothesis of strictly casual links, a similar method is provided that allows one to exactly reconstruct the original graph. Main tools for determining the network topology are based on Wiener, Wiener-Hopf and Granger filtering. Analogies with the problem of Compressing Sensing are drawn and two greedy algorithms to address the problem of reducing the complexity of the network structure are also suggested.}

Averaging theory forms an important basis and provides the theoretical foundations. Effect of dissipative and stiffness properties of the sample on the forces experienced by probe is modeled as changes in parameters of an equivalent linear time invariant model, of the cantilever-sample system. It is shown that this model can be extended to the case when multiple modes of the cantilever participate in the nonlinear interaction with the sample forces.}

Knowledge of such a structure can aid in identifying cause and effect relationships, clustering of similar entities, detecting representative elements for an aggregate and determining reduced order models. Current methods tend to treat observations in a static manner by modeling the measured time series as repeated realizations of as many random variables that are independent over time. This amounts to assume static relationships among the measurements, making these techniques ill-suited for detecting propagative and dynamic phenomena that can be fundamental for the understanding of the system. In this paper we extend techniques for the identification of networks of random variables connected through static relations to the case of random processes with dynamic relations. This is achieved by showing that the Wiener filter defines a relationship among jointly stationary stochastic processes that has the properties of a semi-graphoid.}

 abstract={Microgrids formed by a network of power sources and power consumers yield significant advantages over the conventional power grid including proximity of power consumption to power generation, distributed generation, resiliency against wide area blackouts and ease of incorporation of renewable energy sources. On the other hand, unlike the conventional grid, microgrids are compliant where a single load or a single generation unit can often form a significant fraction of the total generation capacity. Here large excursions from the nominal operating conditions are possible motivating the need for safety mechanisms which isolate power electronic equipment from damage. Breakers serve the purpose of protecting equipment from surge conditions by shutting off, for example, generation units. However in microgrids, a loss of a single generation unit can have catastrophic impact on the viability of the entire system. Here settings on breakers cannot be chosen too conservatively to protect the equipment at the expense of system viability or too liberally which will result in equipment damage. The ensuing problem of striking a suitable compromise tends to be combinatoric in nature due to numerous states of breakers which is further exacerbated by an uncertain load profile and nonlinear nature of system dynamics. In this article we provide a methodology to determine current thresholds and guard times, the time interval when current is allowed to exceed threshold value, for each inverter for fail-safe operation of microgrid. We employ a machine learning approach to address the problem where we first demonstrate that conventional support vector machine (SVM) methodology does not yield a satisfactory solution. We then develop a one-sided SVM method and generalize it to yield nonlinear support boundaries which captures the need for fail-safe operation against system blackouts while protecting equipment. A simulation engine is developed to model a real microgrid which is used to generate data for assessing and guiding our approach.}

 abstract={In microgrids that are predominantly resistive, real and reactive power can be controlled by implementation of voltage and frequency droop laws respectively. However, the variable frequency displayed by such a system complicates analysis such that design approaches rely on approximations and linearized models. In this work, we present a modified form of droop control where only the voltage versus real power relationship is upheld and the frequency is held constant. Since the frequency is not explicitly controlled and the reactive power is not measured, the controller can be simplified. In such a setting, the only assumption we make is that all inverters have access to a common time-reference. Because fixed frequency operation is enforced by design, a variety of analytical tools can be leveraged to formulate a comprehensive analytical framework which facilitates a precise design methodology. In particular, closed-form expressions on the output current phase differences are obtained which yield practical selection guidelines on the voltage-power droop gains such that reactive flows between inverters are kept small. As a corollary, it is demonstrated that there are no reactive power flows in the presence of purely resistive loads. For the particular case of a single inverter, an almost exact solution describing the nonlinear dynamics of the inverter output voltage, current, and power are derived. Accompanying simulation results validate the analytical results and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control approach.}

Also it develops a method for sharing 120 Hz ripple among DC power sources in a prescribed proportion, which accommodates the different capabilities of DC power sources to sustain the ripple. We present a decentralized control architecture, where a nested (inner-outer) control design is used at every converter. An interesting aspect of the proposed design is that the analysis and design of the entire multi-converter system can be done using an equivalent single converter system, where the multi-converter system inherits the performance and robustness achieved by a design for the single-converter system. Another key aspect of this work is that the voltage regulation problem is addressed as a disturbance-rejection problem, where {\em unknown} load current is viewed as an external signal, and thus, no prior information is required on the nominal loading conditions. The control design is obtained using robust optimal-control framework. Case studies presented show the enhanced performance of prescribed optimal controllers.}

It allows to unravel molecular phenomena, to form materials with new chemical and physical properties, or to build objects on an atomic scale. Science on the nanoscale is inherently interdisciplinary. It requires knowledge and insight into many fields, spanning from modeling, measuring, imaging, actuation to control. Often feedback control facilitates operation with molecular precision, despite the fact that many physical phenomena at the molecular level are still not well understood, and that stochastic and nonlinear effects are inherently present. This work provides an insight into some of the current control related research activities on a molecular scale. This is done considering examples from different fields: control related to scanning probe microscopy such as atomic force microscopy, controlled self assembly on a molecular scale, control aspects of molecular transport, and the use of control for manipulation of single molecules using macroscopic probe tips. The hope is that control related researchers, who are not experts in these fields, become aware of the opportunities present, which could also drive new theoretical developments.}

Transfer of beads decorated with cargo under the influence of optical fields provide an attractive means of such transport. Physical models that describe beads in optical fields under the influence of thermal noise are available which yield a qualitative understanding of the bead motion; however, it is difficult to arrive at models that provide quantitative agreement. The first contribution of the article is the determination of a model of a bead under a static field realized by optical forces where the model can be used to predict the motion of the bead under a time-varying optical potential with high fidelity. Close agreement between model based Monte Carlo simulations and experimental observations is seen. The other contribution is a strategy for directed transport of micron-sized particles that utilizes the proposed models to arrive at conclusions which are experimentally verified and easy to implement. The effectiveness of this transport mechanism is justified based on splitting probability computations. Applications to transport of cargo across multiple locations and transport of multiple cargo are experimentally demonstrated.}

 abstract={Summary form only given. The paper deals with the problem of unveiling the link structure of a network of linear dynamical systems. A technique is provided guaranteeing an exact detection of the links of a network of dynamical systems with no undirected cycles (Linear Dynamic Polytrees). In particular, the presence of unobserved (latent) nodes is taken into account. Knowledge on the specific number of hidden processes is not required. It is proven that the topology can be consistently reconstructed, as long the degree of each latent node is at least three with outdegree of at least two. The result extends previous work that was limited to a more restricted class of dynamical systems (Rooted Trees).}

 abstract={Summary form only given; The talk tackles the problem of reconstructing the tree-like topological structure of a network of linear dynamical systems. A distance function is defined in order to evaluate the closeness of two processes and some useful mathematical properties are derived. Theoretical results to guarantee the correctness of the identification procedure for networked linear systems characterized by a tree topology are provided as well. The talk also suggests the approximation of a complex connected network with a tree in order to detect the most meaningful interconnections.}

 abstract={Summary form only given. The paper tackles the problem of identifying an individual transfer function in a network of linear dynamical systems in the presence of loops under the assumptions that (i) only a subset of the nodes is observable, and (ii) data are being passively recorded (i.e. it is not possible to intervene on any part of the system by actively injecting an input). Such a scenario is often encountered in the study of many naturally occurring systems and is also motivated by operating networked systems where the injection of an external signal might lead to undesired disruptions. Sufficient conditions on which signals should be observable to guarantee the identifiability of a desired link are provided. The enabling result is the fact that the notion of d-separation for graphs (see [1], [2]) implies a notion of independence for networks of linear dynamical systems as well [3], allowing one to import identification methodologies developed in different areas. This talk exemplifies how to import methodologies from the domain of graphical models to solve control and identification problems.}

 abstract={Summary form only given. Thermal noise has a significant effect on the functionality of the processes and matter at the molecular and smaller scales. Rational control and interrogation of matter at such small scales necessitates devices which have exquisite resolution to discern the signals where the measurement noise introduced cannot overwhelm the thermal response of matter. In this tutorial, methods that have evolved for rational control and interrogation of matter at the small scale will be explained with specific emphasis on the use of flexure probes and optical forces. In particular biological molecules will be used as a case study with emphasis on motor-proteins based transport inside cells and protein folding and unfolding experiments using flexure probes. Modern control theory and related perspectives hold significant promise in meeting the resolution and band-width needs for interrogation and manipulation of matter at the small scale. In the tutorial, examples on how such methods have overcome perceived limitations will be emphasized. Moreover, the tutorial will highlight avenues for future research and will outline outstanding challenges. The tutorial will be apt for researchers with background in controls; no expertise will be assumed on molecular scale aspects.}

 abstract={Directed transport of intracellular cargo is
predominantly carried out by nanoscale bio-mechanical agents
called molecular motor proteins. Often, multiple motors with
same or different mechano-chemical properties team up to
transport cargoes inside cells. In this article we analyze the
behavior of homogeneous multi-motor ensembles and prove
the existence of a transient state in the state space describing
the various configurations for a two-motor ensemble. We
further show that the various motor configurations for such an
ensemble have a unique steady state probability distribution,
implying that such a system possesses a degree of robustness.
Results of this nature can be extended to ensembles containing
higher number of motors, with the associated steady state distributions providing insights into possible mechanisms employed by motors while transporting a common cargo.}

 abstract={Many complex systems can be described by agents that can be modeled as a network of dynamically interacting cyclo-stationary processes. Such systems arise in areas like power systems and climate sciences. For many of these systems a key objective is to understand mutual influences between various subsystems without altering the natural behavior of the system. Such an objective translates to unveiling the interconnection of the topology of the network using only passive means. Most existing related works have emphasized correlation based methods where interdependencies over different time-instants can be missed. Recent work where dynamic influences are incorporated assuming stationary statistics cannot accommodate applications that arise in many areas such as power and climate sciences. In this article an algorithm based on Wiener filtering is devised for the reconstruction of interconnectivity of dynamically related cyclo-stationary processes. It is shown that all existing interdependencies are detected and spurious detection remains local. Application to a microgrid power network is shown to yield useful insights.}
